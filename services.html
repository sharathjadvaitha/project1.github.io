               <h2 style='color:lightblue;'>HOUSEHOLD DRINKING WATER</h2>
               <p>We believe that access to drinking water is a fundamental human right and our goal is to ensure every household in our geography gets potable drinking water up to 200 litres per day. We bring water from the source to storage reservoir and from there into each household through a robust distribution grid in every water project.
Our team of water engineers and field staff is equipped for conducting overall geophysical and technical surveys while the community does voluntary labor with us to ensure water reaches their homes. Furthermore, for making this water projects sustainable we identify water committees who are representatives of the community and train them extensively for operations and maintenance of their hamlet’s water project.</p>

             <div><br/>
               <h2 style='color:lightblue;'>SANITATION</h2>
               <p>Just like access to water is of prime importance, having a household toilet is critical to the development of rural areas. Our goal is to ensure every individual from a rural family has access to a toilet in his household and uses it every day. In cases where there are space constraints in a household premise, not more than two households will share a single toilet. For sustainability and behavior change we organize various street plays, community-led total sanitation programme, swachhta raths, rallies and other modes to engage with the community and ensure an open defecation free geography.</p>

             <div><br/>
               <h2 style='color:lightblue;'>WATER FOR IRRIGATION</h2>
               <p>Cultivation of second and third crop in a year leads to good income augmentation of farmers and empowers them to come out of poverty, restricts migration and improves their standard of living. For year-long agricultural cultivation, regular supply of irrigation is a must. We have identified small tributaries in our six blocks, where we build check dams to conserve millions of litres of water. This water is supplied to the farms through drip or flood irrigation thus making acres and acres of land cultivable and beneficial for farmers in the geography.</p>

           <p>While 60% of India's population is directly dependent on agriculture, its contribution to the country's GDP is only 20%, indicating overdependence, unemployment and underemployment in the sector. With more than half the country's populations' direct dependence on this sector, we believe that there is a need to bring paradigm shift towards agriculture and its numerous tangible and intangible benefits.</p>

               <h2 style='color:green;'>ON-FARM PROGRAMME</h2>
               <p>The focus here is on bringing more cultivable land under assured irrigation, thus enabling farmers to sow economically viable crops like vegetables in rabi season, and increasing productivity and survival percentage of existing and recently planted orchards. These initiatives are bolstered by exposure visits for new adoptees and imparting technical knowledge by agri domain experts which aids in augmenting income levels of farmers who are otherwise largely dependent on growing rainfed paddy in the kharif season.</p>

               <h2 style='color:green;'>OFF-FARM PROGRAMME</h2>
               <p>Off-farm activities include dairy, goat rearing, fishing and poultry. Dairy is introduced to  develop an ecosystem around dairy farming and promote dairy as a sustainable livelihood option, which creates a steady revenue stream throughout the year for households. It also includes providing sustainability options to farmers like hydroponic fodder, azolla, mineral mixture, nutrition management and advisory services coupled with market linkages.Poultry is tailor made for the weaker sections of the community who are unable to adopt other economic development programmes. It provides a regular revenue and healthy protein source for the community. The focus here is on women SHGs and is helping in developing their entrepreneur skills. Goat rearing as a livelihood option is being adopted mainly by the tribal community, women lead households and poorest of poor sections of the society. Swades has helped in introduction of improved breeds of goat, veterinary support and health advisory to strengthen and make this programme sustainable.</p>

               <h2 style='color:green;'>NON-FARM PROGRAMME</h2>
               <p>The non- farm activities include skills training to youths and their placement in formal employment and enterprise development. It aims at enhancing the skills of the unemployed youth, thus empowering them to be placed in better jobs with higher salaries. This helps in augmenting the income levels of the household and instills a sense of pride amongst rural youth. Supporting new entrepreneurs with adequate training, exposure visits and best practises for enterprise development is also a part of the non-farm programme.</p>
